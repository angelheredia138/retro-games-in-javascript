2048

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

Pong

Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It's a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. Control the paddle and score points by hitting the ball past your opponent.

Snake

Snake is a classic arcade game where the player maneuvers a line (the snake) which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle.

Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game. The objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them, with the help of clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
