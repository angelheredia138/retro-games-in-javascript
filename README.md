Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It's a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. Control the paddle and score points by hitting the ball past your opponent.


### Snake

Snake is a classic arcade game where the player maneuvers a line (the snake) which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle.
